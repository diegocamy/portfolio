      "A simple blog app to create, share and discover recipes. nline I guess I was bored and decided to create a project using GraphQL, at first it wasn't going to be a blog about recipes because I was decided to clone dev.to, but then I thought it was better to create something from scratch and it would be more fun so that's how REcetas was born. nline It was really challenging and fun to learn about GraphQL and implementing it with Typescript. I decided to use Typegraphql with Typeorm and store the data using postgres. ",
